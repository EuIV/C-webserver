# simple C webserver
The goal of this project is to have a simple webserver in C that can serve web pages, I'm doing it as a simple pratice project
## Current situation
This program prints what's received on console, and sends back www/index.html no matter the request, with basic http headers
## TODO
+ File detection on www
+ File type detection of those files for Content-Type header
